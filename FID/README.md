# FID Metric Evaluation

This metric is used to evaluate images using the FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) metric. The FID metric is commonly used to assess the quality of images generated by generative models by comparing the generated images to real images.

## Overview

The framework performs the following steps:
1. **Load the Model**: Initializes the Inception v3 model for FID computation.
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Preprocesses the input images using the appropriate pipeline.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features for both the real and generated images using the Inception v3 model.
4. **FID Computation**: Computes the FID score between the real and generated images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for optimal performance)
- PyTorch
- torchvision

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.ecodesamsung.com/SRIB-PRISM/CITB_23RSG25_Develop_a_Quality_Assurance_framework_for_Image_Generation_Models
    cd "CITB_23RSG25_Develop_a_Quality_Assurance_framework_for_Image_Generation_Models"
    cd FID
    ```

2. **Custom Model Training**:
    The weights from online image recognition models were found insufficient for our study. Therefore, training a custom model on a custom dataset is necessary.
